# Security Guidelines

## üö® CRITICAL: Environment Variables and API Keys

**IMPORTANT**: This repository has been secured to prevent future leaks of sensitive information. All environment files containing real credentials have been removed from git tracking.

## What Was Secured

- ‚úÖ Removed `services/backend/env.development` from git tracking (contained real Supabase credentials)
- ‚úÖ Removed `services/backend/env.production` from git tracking (contained placeholder credentials)
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive `.gitignore` file to prevent future leaks
- ‚úÖ Added safe example files: `env.development.example` and `env.production.example`

## How to Set Up Your Environment

### 1. Development Environment

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp services/backend/env.development.example services/backend/env.development

# Edit the file with your actual credentials
nano services/backend/env.development
```

### 2. Production Environment

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp services/backend/env.production.example services/backend/env.production

# Edit the file with your actual credentials
nano services/backend/env.production
```

## Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:

- Use `.env.example` files for templates
- Keep real credentials in local `.env` files only
- Use environment-specific files (`.env.development`, `.env.production`)
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use least-privilege access for API keys

### ‚ùå DON'T:

- Commit `.env` files to git
- Share API keys in code reviews
- Use the same keys across environments
- Store credentials in plain text files
- Commit secrets to public repositories

## Environment File Structure

```
services/backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ env.development.example    # Template for development
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ env.production.example     # Template for production
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ env.development           # Your local dev credentials (gitignored)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ env.production            # Your local prod credentials (gitignored)
```

## What's Protected by .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file now protects:

- All `.env*` files (except `.env.example` and `.env.template`)
- API key files
- Secret configuration files
- Credential files
- SSL/TLS certificates
- SSH keys
- Cloud service account files
- Database files
- Log files
- Build outputs
- Node modules
- IDE configuration files

## Emergency Response

If you accidentally commit sensitive information:

1. **Immediate Action**: Remove the file from git tracking

   ```bash
   git rm --cached <file-with-secrets>
   ```

2. **Rotate Credentials**: Change all exposed API keys immediately

3. **Audit Repository**: Check git history for other sensitive files

4. **Update .gitignore**: Ensure the file type is properly ignored

## Monitoring

Regularly check for:

- Files that might contain secrets
- Commits that include sensitive data
- Environment files in unexpected locations
- Hardcoded credentials in source code

## Additional Security Measures

Consider implementing:

- Pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets
- Automated security scanning
- Regular dependency vulnerability checks
- Code review guidelines for security
- Environment variable validation
